        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>Working with your partner, experiment with jQuery & AJAX.</p>
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>I was very excited about this. I went searching for all kinds of API's but wanted
				the Mars Rover pics. I tried a lot of variations but it would not work. What
				I really wanted was images from Harvart Art but those did not work either. As I continued to read,
				it seemed like I was missing some functionality that was too advanced for me. I ended up
				getting my own API key from NASA and went with the photo of the day. That worked.</p>
				<h2>Result</h2>

				<button id="press-me"
				style="background: #44c6e3;color: white;font-size: 15px">
				PRESS ME TO RELOAD IMAGES
				</button>
