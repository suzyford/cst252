// OOP Design for Hangman
// class Hangman
// initialize
// set up the letterbox, user types here to guess a letterbox
// set up the msgBox, tell user to guess next letter and when the game is over
//set up wordBox, letters are added in their positions as they're correctly guessed
//set up guessesBox, display of letters guessed incorrectly
// set up the player
// assign the starting player

//play
  // loop infiniteky
  // call the board rendering method
  // generate a word at random and store it in a variable
  // display the length of the word to the user

//check game over
  // correct_guesses is less than the length of the word
  //prompt the user to guess a letter
  //if the guess is correct increment correct_guesses by 1
  //if the guess is incorrect increment incorrect_guesses by 1
  // and draw the next part of the hangman

//check victory
//if the incorrect_guesses is greater than 8, tell the user
//they lost and exit the program
//if correct_guesses is equal to the length of the word, tell the user they won

//loop
//refresh to start a new game
