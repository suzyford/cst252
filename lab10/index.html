	<h1> Art & Suzy's Lab 10:<span id="title"> JavaScript Events and Forms</span></h1>
	<p>Working together, we experimented with functions and elements that would be able to take user input.
		We also used sort from Lab 7.</p>
	<h2> Challenge</h2>
	<p> Our challenge was revisiting all our notes and lecture from class to figure things out.</p>
	<h2> Problems</h2>
	<p> Like last lab, it just took a little while to get the JavaScript correct.
		We felt there was a big missing peice of the JavaScript so we had to peek at
		Wes' js page and it was an eyeopener! Some foreign stuff there, but, we eventually peiced it all together and
		learned as we went through the code.</p>
	<p>We also took the time to figure out how to pad the input box to have it align with the rest of the text
		on the page.</p>
	<h2> Results</h2>
	<p> We are happy with the results of our page and the assignment in general.
