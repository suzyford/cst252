//Find a reliable recipe
    //Gather all the ingredients
       //Mix the dough ingredients together by hand or use a hand-held or stand mixer.
           //Whisk the warm water, yeast, and granulated sugar together.
           //Add the olive oil, salt, and flour.
       //Knead by hand or beat the dough with your mixer for 2 minutes.
       //Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.
           //With lightly floured hands, knead the dough for 3-4 minutes.
       //Place dough into a greased mixing bowl.
           //Cover tightly, and set aside to rise for about 90 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator.
       //Punch down risen dough to release air bubbles. Divide in 2.
       //Roll dough out into a 12-inch circle.
           //Sprinkle flour on a clean work surface and use a rolling pin.
       //Lightly grease baking sheet or pizza pan with nonstick spray or olive oil.
       //Using lightly floured hands, stretch and flatten the disc onto the pan.
       //Preheat the oven to 475°F (246°C). Allow it to heat for at least 15-20 minutes as you shape the pizza.
       //Top with favorite pizza toppings.
       //Bake for 15 minutes or until the bottom crust is golden brown.
