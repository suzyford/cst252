<h1> Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
<h2> Big Idea</h2>
<p>Working with a partner, further create a local file structure on your computer, add index.html files, and upload to the server. </p>
​
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p> It was a smooth lab overall but the challenge we had was so many screenshoots to organize.</p>
​
<h2>Results</h2>
<p> Here are the results below, with our screenshots.</p>
