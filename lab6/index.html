		 			<h1> Art & Suzy' Index for Lab 6 </h1>
		 			<p>Working together, we experimented with basic
						JavaScript data types, arrays, and object.</p>
					<h2> Challenge</h2>
					<p> We thought we'd give this a shot without looking at your example and mildly failed.
						HTML was smooth sailing. Js was not, even though it seems like such an easy thing to do!</p>
					<h2> Problems</h2>
					<p> After our fail, we went and and typed verbatim, your js. Each and everything.
						It did not take so we went to W3Schools
						to see if we could find the problem. </p>
						<p> We exhausted all the resources there and still were unable to find a solution.</p>
						<p> FINALLY...the one tiny thing that made the difference to success: Under "defined variables,
							the word "ourTransport", did not match in the output. We had ourTransportation instead.
							That slight change was the winner! Silly is the only word that describes a few hours of
							problem solving.</p>
					<h2> Results</h2>
					<p> You're looking at the index.html file we created. Here is the execution:</p>

							<h2>Script Output</h2>
