		 			<h1> Art & Suzy' Index for Lab 7 </h1>
		 			<p>Working together, we experimented with writing Functions
						that take user input.</p>
					<h2> Challenge</h2>
					<p> We didn't experience major challenges</p>
					<h2> Problems</h2>
					<p> What we did find is that the details again come back to bite us. There was some confussion
					in var with nameArray, nameArraySort, and nameSorted. Which one goes where and why? In console.log we
				figured out the pattern.</p>
				<p> Once the code was correct, it was interesting to see the pop up where we could type names (or anything) there. Nice surprise.
					<h2> Results</h2>
					<p> You're looking at the index.html file we created. Here is the execution:</p>

							<h2>Script Output</h2>
							<script src="js/lab7.js"></script>
