		 		<h1> Art & Suzy's Index for Lab 5 </h1>
		 			<p>Working together, we experimented with basic
						JavaScript data types and variables.</p>
					<h2> Challenge</h2>
					<p> Our challenge was learning this new language and figuring out how it all works together.</p>
					<p> We also could not figure out how to edit the script for the list of script output in the index.html. We tried hard...lol</p>
					<h2> Problems</h2>
					<p> Simple thing such as forgetting the small details that messed up the entire code (like putting an = in somewhere)</p>
					<h2> Results</h2>
					<p> You're looking at the index.html file we created. Here is the execution:</p>
					<div>
							<h2> Script Output</h2>
							<script src="js/lab.js"></script>
					</div>
				</div>
			</body>
